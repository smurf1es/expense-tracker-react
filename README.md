This project is originated from the youtube guy named Traversy Media. He's had good tutorials out there.
And I coded along the tutorial to then be uploaded on github, my own github. Please check out the cool dude https://github.com/bradtraversy/expense-tracker-react
\*To run the project

1. npm install / yarn install (which ever package installer you use)
2. npm start / yarn start (it will launch localhost:3000 automatically on your preferred browser)

Thank you so much, once again I <strong>do not</strong> own this project idea.
